### 🎨 Design Patterns

- **[Decorator Pattern](src/main/java/org/example/DecoratorPattern/)**  
  Add responsibilities to objects dynamically without altering their structure.

- **[Factory Pattern](src/main/java/org/example/FactoryPattern/)**  
  Encapsulate object creation logic for improved flexibility and scalability.

- **[Observer Pattern](src/main/java/org/example/ObserverPattern/)**  
  Implement publish-subscribe behavior between objects.

- **[Strategy Pattern](src/main/java/org/example/strategy/)**  
  Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.

- **[Without Strategy](src/main/java/org/example/withoutstrategy/)**  
  Shows how the same logic looks **without** applying the Strategy Pattern for contrast.

### 💡 Interview Questions

- **[Parking Lot System](src/main/java/org/example/questions/parkinglot/)**  
  A commonly asked design question in system design interviews.  
  Includes:  
  - `DemoExample.java`: Demonstrates core logic for parking lot management.
